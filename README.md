The point of this project was to dynamically populate html templates with the appropriate data for our topic. Our topic was greenhouse emissions in the world. We were able to break these down by sector(the type of emission) country, and year. We had an html template for each of those and we put in a placeholder in the html files that would eventually be replaced with the data being queried. That brings me to my next point, in our javascript file we created queries to satisfy searching for emissions in a country in a given year. That way if someone wanted to say search "country=United States & year=2019" that would give us the total greenhouse emissions for the United States in the year 2019. 

What would be the purpose of this website to people who are not a Computer Science major? It could be used for someone who was environmentally conscious. What's cool about this project is that we could track year by year, via graphs and pie charts, which emissions are contributing to the destruction of our climate and if someone who was "green" wanted to do their part to fix the planet, they would know where to start. It also raises an eyebrow by seeing that the United States was 1st in almost every year from 1990-2004 and then we were surpassed by China from there on out.
